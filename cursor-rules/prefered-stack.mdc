# Prefered Stack

I am opinionated on what technology I want to use. When implementing something, always follow the current stack within the repo and dont migrate to others unless otherwise directed.
If you are writing something new or do have an option to choose, then below are the preferend choices to make:

```
Language: Typescript
UI: Nextjs
Cloud: AWS
Database: DynamoDB
CI/CD: Github Actions
Testing: Vitest
Version Control: Git
Linting: biomejs
```
